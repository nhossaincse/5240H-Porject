abstract = {The rapid development of artificial intelligence places high demands on human–machine interfaces. Various types of huma–machine interfaces have been implemented, including smart keyboards, electronic skins, and wearable motion sensors. Handwriting behavior has a high degree of interaction freedom, and handwriting characteristics offer high-security standards for human–machine systems. Herein, we propose a portable smart pen integrated with triboelectric displacement vector sensors to trace handwriting trajectories for human–machine interactions and biometric identification. A triboelectric pressure sensor array is evenly distributed along the pen case to sense displacement vectors, and an additional triboelectric sensor is placed on top of the pen to detect vertical force. By leveraging the resin pen refill as a tribopositive material and a nanowired polyethylene tribonegative layer attached to a Cu electrode, triboelectric signals are generated during the writing/moving process. The calculation and analysis of the sensor signals enable the recognition of handwritten patterns, including Latin letters and Arabic numerals. Moreover, the smart pen can be used to authenticate users based on their unique handwriting patterns, which can help take human–machine interfaces and cyber security to the next level. Furthermore, a custom smart pen operation mode that enables the control of a slide presentation demonstrates the smart pen’s potential for various human–machine interface applications.},

abstract = {Today, Smartphone is a necessary device for people connected to the Internet world. But user privacy and security are still playing important roles in the usage of mobile devices. The user was asked to enter related characters, numbers or drawing a simple graphic on the touch screen as passwords for unlocking the screensaver. Although it could provide the user with a simple and convenient security authentication mechanism, the process is hard to protect against the privacy information leakage under the strict security policy. Nowadays, various keypad lock screen Apps usually provides different type of schemes in unlocking the mobile device screen, such as simple-customized pattern, swipe-to-unlock with a static image and so on. But the vulnerability could provide a chance to hijacker to find out the leakage of graphic pattern information that influences in user information privacy and security.This paper proposes a new graphic pattern authentication mechanism to enhance the strength of that in the keypad lock screen Apps. It integrates random digital graphics and handwriting graphic input track recognition technologies to provide better and more diverse privacy protection and reduce the risk of vulnerability. The proposed mechanism is based on two factor identification scheme. First of all, it randomly changes digital graphic position based on unique passwords every time to increase the difficulty of the stealer's recording. Second, the input track of handwriting graphics is another identification factor for enhancing the complex strength of user authentication as well.},
